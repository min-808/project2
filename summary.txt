I met all the requirement of the project, and implemented the
three extra credit points (copy constructor, overloaded assignment
operator, and overloaded << operator). Additionally, I added debug
mode to all of the constructors and new methods, and separated
the debug mode outputs from the normal output. A future enhancement
could be adding "touch *cpp" to the make files in order to force
the object files to recompile so that the linkage would work correctly
for the debug mode flag. Another enhancement could be adding an
"edit" option to the UI, allowing you to change the name or address.
